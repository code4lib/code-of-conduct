Code4Lib seeks to provide a welcoming, professionally engaging, fun, and
safe conference experience and ongoing community for everyone. We do not
tolerate harassment in any form. Discriminatory language and imagery
(including sexual) is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks,
or any community channel such as the chatroom or mailing list.

Harassment is understood as any behavior that threatens or demeans another
person or group, or produces an unsafe environment.  It includes offensive
verbal comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender identity,
gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, age, religious or political beliefs; sexual or
discriminatory images in public spaces (including online); deliberate
intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording;
sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

## Conflict Resolution

1. Initial Incident

    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
    or have any other concerns, __and you feel comfortable speaking with
    the offender__, please inform the offender that he/she/ze has affected you
    negatively. Oftentimes, the offending behavior is unintentional, and the
    accidental offender and offended will resolve the incident by having
    that initial discussion.

    Code4Lib recognizes that there are many reasons speaking directly to
    the offender may not be workable for you (including but not limited to
    unfamiliarity with the conference or its participants, [lack of spoons](https://web.archive.org/web/20191117210039/https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/),
    and concerns for personal safety). If you don't feel comfortable
    speaking directly with the offender for any reason, skip straight to
    step 2.

2. Escalation

    If the offender insists that he/she/ze did not offend, if offender is
    actively harassing you, or if direct engagement is not a good option
    for you at this time, then you will need a third party to step in.

    If you are at a conference or other event,
    find the on-call [Community Support Volunteer](csvcharge.md) or the event
    organizer or staff person. For all Code4Lib-affiliated events, these parties
    must be clearly listed on a publicly-accessible website such as the
    conference website, [in this Code of Conduct repository](css_volunteers.md),
    or [the wiki](http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Main_Page).
    If you can't find any of these, there will be other staff
    available to help if the situation calls for immediate action.

    The primary way to reach a Community Support Volunteer online is to email
    the c4lcommunitysupport@googlegroups.com address. Messages sent here are
    visible to all Community Support Volunteers and are kept private. You may
    use a throwaway email address if you want to ensure anonymity.

    If you are in the #code4lib IRC, the zoia command to list people
    designated as channel helpers is `@helpers`. There is at least one helper
    in the channel at most times. Helpers may not be Community Support
    Volunteers but know how to direct you to them.

    If you are in the code4lib Slack, you may reach a volunteer by including
    either the phrase `c4lcsv` or `c4lcss` in a message posted to a public
    channel, such as `#general` or `#code4libcon`. You may also private message
    a known member of the Community Support Squad—their names and Slack handles
    will be posted on the aforementioned publicly-accessible website(s).

3. Wider community response to Incident:

    If the incident doesn't pass the first step (discussion reveals offense
    was unintentional, apologies said, public note or community is informed
    of resolution), then there's not much the community can do at this point
    since the incident was resolved without outside intervention.

    If incident results in corrective action, the community should support
    the decision made by the Help in Step 2 if they choose corrective action,
    like ending a talk early or banning from the listserv, as well as
    support those harmed by the incident, either publicly or privately
    (whatever individuals are comfortable with).

    If the Help in Step 2 run into issues implementing the CoC, then the
    Help should come to the community with these issues and the community
    should revise the CoC as they see fit.

    In Real Life people will have opinions about how the CoC is enforced.
    People will argue that a particular decision was unfair, and others will
    say that it didn't go far enough. We can't stop people having
    opinions, but what we could do here is have constructive discussions
    that lead to something tangible (affirmation of decision, change in CoC,
    modify decision, etc,).

## Sanctions

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender,
expulsion from the Code4Lib event, or banning the offender from a chatroom
or mailing list.

Specific sanctions may include but are not limited to:

* warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports
will result in other sanctions
* requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical
proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event
* early termination of a talk that violates the policy
* not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy
* not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at
the event
* immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the
harasser holds requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future Code4lib
events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
* requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return
* banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a
certain time period)
* banning the harasser from any (or all) Code4Lib channels
* publishing an account of the harassment


Code4Lib event organizers can be identified by their name badges, and will
help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement,
provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel
safe for the duration of the event. Code4Lib IRC volunteers can be identified
by issuing the `@helpers` command to the #code4lib bot named "zoia".

In the case of organized events, those responsible for the event should have readily available the following information:

* **Conference organizer:** [ORGANIZER NAME], [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[CONFERENCE HOTEL NAME]:** [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[MUNICIPALITY] Police Department**: [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[LOCAL SEXUAL ASSAULT/CRISIS LINE]:** [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[TAXI COMPANY NAME]:** [PHONE NUMBER]
* **Community Support Volunteers:** including the [PHONE NUMBER]


We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues,
conference-related social events, community gatherings, and online communication channels.

We value everyone's participation in the Code4Lib community, and will all
work to keep Code4Lib a safe and friendly space for all participants!
