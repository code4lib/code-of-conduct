CodeOfConduct4Lib
=================

Code4Lib is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do
not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual or
discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate for any event
venue, including talks. Participants at any Code4Lib event event
violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion
of the organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
religion, sexual and or discriminatory images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender
or expulsion from the Code4Lib event. If you are being harassed,
notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
concerns, please contact a Code4Lib event organizer immediately.

Code4Lib organizers can be identified by their name badges, and will
help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law
enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing
harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues,
conference-related social events, and community gatherings and
channels (including the Code4Lib listserv and the #code4lib IRC
channel).

We value your participation in the Code4Lib community!
