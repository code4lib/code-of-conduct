Code4Lib seeks to provide a welcoming, fun, and safe community and
conference experience and ongoing Community for everyone. We do not
tolerate harassment in any form. Discriminatory language and imagery
(including sexual) is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks,
or any community channel such as the chatroom or mailing list. Participants at
any Code4Lib event or in any community channel violating these rules should
expect to be sanctioned, expelled, or banned at the discretion of the
organizers or channel administrators or volunteers. Reports of harassment will
be addressed immediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone
else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please *speak up* and/or
contact an event organizer, volunteer, or a "Code4lib helper" in person
(if at an event) or over IRC immediately.

Harassment is understood as any behavior that threatens another person or group, or produces an unsafe environment.
It includes offensive verbal comments or non-verbal expressions related to
gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, age, religious beliefs, sexual or
discriminatory images in public spaces (including online), deliberate
intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may take any action
they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the
Code4Lib event, or banning the offender from a chatroom or mailing list.

Specific sanctions may include but are not limited to:

* warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports
will result in other sanctions
* requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical
proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event
* early termination of a talk that violates the policy
* not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy
* not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at
the event
* immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the
harasser holds requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future Code4lib
events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
* requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return
* banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a
certain time period)
* publishing an account of the harassment

Code4Lib event organizers can be identified by their name badges, and will
help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement,
provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel
safe for the duration of the event. Code4Lib IRC volunteers can be identified
by issuing the `@helpers` command to the #code4lib bot named "zoia".

If an incident occurs, please use the following contact information:

* **Conference organizer:** [ORGANIZER NAME], [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[CONFERENCE HOTEL NAME]:** [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[MUNICIPALITY] Police Department**: [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[LOCAL SEXUAL ASSAULT/CRISIS LINE]:** [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[TAXI COMPANY NAME]:** [PHONE NUMBER]
* **IRC channel administrators:** [IRC USERNAMES] (TODO: reference to
    `@helpers`?)

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues,
conference-related social events, and community gatherings and channels
(including the Code4Lib listserv, [Code4Lib subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/code4lib) and the #code4lib IRC channel).

We value your participation in the Code4Lib community, and your efforts to
keep Code4Lib a safe and friendly space for all participants!
