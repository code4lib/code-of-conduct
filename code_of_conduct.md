Code4Lib is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community
experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do
not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual or
discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate for any event
venue, including talks. Reports of harrassment will be addressed 
immediately. Participants at any Code4Lib event -- or in
any community channel, such as the chatroom or mailing list --
violating these rules should expect to be
sanctioned, expelled, or banned at the discretion of the organizers
or channel administrators.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments or non-verbal expressions
related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, religion, sexual and or discriminatory images in public
spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may take
any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender,
expulsion from the Code4Lib event, or banning the offender from a
chatroom or mailing list. If you are being harassed, notice that
someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
contact a Code4Lib event organizer or channel administrator
immediately.

Specific sanctions may include but are not limited to:

* warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further
reports will result in other sanctions
* requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical
proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event
* ending a talk that violates the policy early
* not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy
* not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks
at the event
* immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges
the harasser holds requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future
Code4lib events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
* requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return
* banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a
certain time period)
* publishing an account of the harassment

Code4Lib event organizers can be identified by their name badges, and
will help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law
enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing
harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.

If an incident occurs, please use the following contact information:

* **Conference organizer:** [ORGANIZER NAME], [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[CONFERENCE HOTEL NAME]:** [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[MUNICIPALITY] Police Department**: [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[LOCAL SEXUAL ASSAULT/CRISIS LINE]:** [PHONE NUMBER]

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues,
conference-related social events, and community gatherings and

channel).

We value your participation in the Code4Lib community!
