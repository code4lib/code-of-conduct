Code4Lib seeks to provide a welcoming, fun, and safe community and
conference experience and ongoing community for everyone. We do not
tolerate harassment in any form. Discriminatory language and imagery
(including sexual) is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks,
or any community channel such as the chatroom or mailing list.

Harassment is understood as any behavior that threatens another person or
group, or produces an unsafe environment.  It includes offensive verbal
comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender identity,
gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, age, religious beliefs, sexual or discriminatory images
in public spaces (including online), deliberate intimidation, stalking,
following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of 
talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention.

## Conflict Resolution

1. Initial Incident

    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
    or have any other concerns, please inform the offender that he/she has
    affected you negatively. Oftentimes, the offending behavior is
    unintentional, and the accidental offender and offended will resolve the
    incident by having that initial discussion.

2. Escalation 

    If the offender insists that he/she did not offend, or if offender is
    actively harassing you, then you will need a third party to step in.

    If you are at a conference or other event, find the event organizer or
    staff person. For #c4l13, that would be Francis Kayiwa. If you can't find 
    the event organizer, there will be other staff available to help if the
    situation calls for immediate action.

    If you are in the #code4lib IRC, the zoia command to list people
    designated as channel helpers is @helpers . I'd assume that there is
    at least one helper in the channel at most times.

    For the listserv, you have a free-for-all for public messages; however,
    the listserv does have a maintainer, Eric Lease Morgan.

3. Wider community response to Incident:

    If the incident doesn't pass the first step (discussion reveals offense
    was unintentional, apologies said, public note or community is informed
    of resolution), then there's not much the community can do at this point
    since the incident was resolved without outside intervention.

    If incident results in corrective action, the community should support
    the decision made by the Help in Step 2 if they choose corrective action,
    like ending a talk early or banning from the listserv, as well as
    support those harmed by the incident, either publicly or privately
    (whatever individuals are comfortable with).

    If the Help in Step 2 run into issues implementing the CoC, then the
    Help should come to the community with these issues and the community
    should revise the CoC as they see fit.

    In Real Life people will have opinions about how the CoC is enforced.
    People will argue that a particular decision was unfair, and others will
    say that it didn't go far enough. We really can't stop people having
    opinions, but what we could do here is have constructive discussions
    that lead to something tangible (affirmation of decision, change in CoC,
    modify decision, etc,), instead of reproducing the comments section of a
    story on a news site.

## Sanctions

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender,
expulsion from the Code4Lib event, or banning the offender from a chatroom
or mailing list.

Specific sanctions may include but are not limited to:

* warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports
will result in other sanctions
* requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical
proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event
* early termination of a talk that violates the policy
* not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy
* not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at
the event
* immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the
harasser holds requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future Code4lib
events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
* requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return
* banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a
certain time period)
* publishing an account of the harassment

Code4Lib event organizers can be identified by their name badges, and will
help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement,
provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel
safe for the duration of the event. Code4Lib IRC volunteers can be identified
by issuing the `@helpers` command to the #code4lib bot named "zoia".

If an incident occurs, please use the following contact information:

* **Conference organizer:** [ORGANIZER NAME], [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[CONFERENCE HOTEL NAME]:** [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[MUNICIPALITY] Police Department**: [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[LOCAL SEXUAL ASSAULT/CRISIS LINE]:** [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[TAXI COMPANY NAME]:** [PHONE NUMBER]
* **IRC channel administrators:** [IRC USERNAMES] (TODO: reference to
    `@helpers`?)

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues,
conference-related social events, community gatherings, and online communication channels.

We value your participation in the Code4Lib community, and your efforts to
keep Code4Lib a safe and friendly space for all participants!
