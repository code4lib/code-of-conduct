CodeOfConduct4Lib
=================

Code4Lib is dedicated to providing harassment-free community
experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do
not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual or
discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate for any event
venue, including talks. Reports of harrassment will be addressed 
immediately. Participants at any Code4Lib event -- or in
any community channel, such as the chatroom or mailing list --
violating these rules should expect to be  
sanctioned, expelled, or banned at the discretion of the organizers
or channel administrators.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
religion, sexual and or discriminatory images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may take
any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender,
expulsion from the Code4Lib event, or banning the offender from a
chatroom or mailing list. If you are being harassed, notice that
someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
contact a Code4Lib event organizer or channel administrator
immediately.

Code4Lib event organizers can be identified by their name badges, and
will help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law
enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing
harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues,
conference-related social events, and community gatherings and
channels (including the Code4Lib listserv and the #code4lib IRC
channel).

We value your participation in the Code4Lib community!
