Code4Lib seeks to provide a welcoming, professionally engaging, fun, and safe
conference experience and ongoing Community for everyone. We do not
tolerate discrimination or harassment in any form. Discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks,
or any community channel such as the chatroom or mailing list. Any community member can and 
should speak up when conduct or expression creates an uncomfortable environment for that member. 


Reports of harrassment will
be addressed immediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone
else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please *speak up* and/or
contact an event organizer, volunteer, or a "Code4lib helper" in person
(if at an event) or over IRC immediately.

Harassment is understood as any behavior that demeans another person or group, or produces an unsafe environment.
It includes offensive verbal comments or non-verbal expressions related to
gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, age, religious or political beliefs; sexual or
discriminatory images in public spaces (including online); deliberate
intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording;
sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may take any action
they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the
Code4Lib event, or banning the offender from a chatroom or mailing list. 

Code4Lib event organizers can be identified by their name badges. Code4Lib IRC volunteers can be identified
by issuing the `@helpers` command to the #code4lib bot named "zoia".

In the case of organized events, those responsible for the event should have readily available 
the following information.

* **Conference organizer:** [ORGANIZER NAME], [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[MUNICIPALITY] Police Department**: [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[LOCAL SEXUAL ASSAULT/CRISIS LINE]:** [PHONE NUMBER]

We value everyone's participation in the Code4Lib community, and will all work to
keep Code4Lib a safe and friendly space for all participants!

*Based on the [example policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment)
from the [Geek Feminism wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/), created by the
Ada Initiative and other volunteers.*
