# Code4Lib 2024 Community Support Squad Transparency Report

## Summary

The Community Support Squad (CSS) were mobilized throughout the conference to respond to violations of the Code4Lib Code of Conduct and address any other related issues. Soojeong Herring was the coordinator. Ann Marie Mesco, Bobbi Fox, Andromeda Yelton, Bess Sadler, Michael Giarlo, and Coral Sheldon-Hess served as Community Support Volunteers (CSVs) in online and in-person capacities. Natasha Allen was the Local Planning Committee (LPC) Liaison to the CSS and a CSV. CSVs were provided with background reading before the conference, and an online training session was held prior to the conference in Ann Arbor, MI.

There were at least two CSVs on duty in person during all official conference proceedings, including the reception and game night, and during every shift there was an additional online-only CSV dedicated to monitoring online activity. CSVs were identified by black-and-white striped lanyards and stationed in the back of the main room. CSVs were made available to take reports in person and via web form. We used a private Slack channel to coordinate logistics, discuss issues, and come to consensus on responses.

### Incidents and Responses

No incidents were reported.

### Recommendations

1. Seating arrangement: Prior to the conference, the coordinator met with Concentra and the LPC members to discuss the seating arrangements for the in-person conference. The planned set up was to have a separate rectangle table for the CSV members. However, the actual set up was a shared round table other attendees. The shared table became an issue when it was used during the breakout sessions when their seat were occupied by other attendees while the volunteers were away. This was an unexpected situation for the LPC members as well. The coordinators will communicate with future LPCs and Concentra to secure dedicated seating spots for the volunteers.
1. Volunteer recruitment and shifts: The coordinator called for volunteers before the vetting process with extended due date to encourage participation. However, there were fewer volunteers this year compared to previous years, and CSVs had more shifts to take during the in-person conference. The CSVs held a debriefing meeting and discussed possible one volunteer per shift if the volunteers have previous experience.
    - CSV will make sure that new volunteers will be paired with an experience volunteer during the shift (two volunteers for the shifts)
    - CSV will brainstorm to invite new members to distribute shifts evenly (e.g. holding a session to introduce and a Q&A session, giving a short presentation during a lightening talk session, etc.).
    - CSV will keep the one online volunteer per shift.
1. Identification on Slack: During the conference, the volunteers identified themselves by adding a purple heart emoji to their Slack ID. Several volunteers reported difficulty in adding the emoji.
    - The coordinator will provide clear instructions on how to add a purple heart emoji, ensuring all volunteers can properly identify themselves on Slack during the conference.
