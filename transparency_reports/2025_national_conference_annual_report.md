# Code4Lib 2025 Community Support Squad Transparency Report

## Summary

The Community Support Squad (CSS) were mobilized throughout the conference to respond to violations of the Code4Lib Code of Conduct and address any other related issues. Soojeong Herring was the coordinator and Caleb Derven was the co-coordinator. Ann Marie Mesco, Bobbi Fox, Andromeda Yelton, Thomas Dowling, Natasha Allen, Eric Phettleplace, Mike Giarlo, Kate Lynch, Michelle S. Navarro and Andrew Battelini served as Community Support Volunteers (CSVs) in online and in-person capacities. Esm√© Cowles was the Local Planning Committee (LPC) Liaison to the CSS and a CSV. CSVs were provided with background reading before the conference, and an online training session was held prior to the conference in Princeton, N.J.

There were at least two CSVs on duty in person during all official conference proceedings and the reception. One CSV covered the game night. At every shift during the main conference there was an additional online-only CSV dedicated to monitoring online activity. CSVs were identified by black-and-white striped lanyards and stationed in the back of the conference room. CSVs were made available to take reports in person and via web form. We used a private Slack channel to coordinate logistics, discuss issues, and come to consensus on responses.

### Incidents and Responses

No incidents were reported.

### Recommendations/ Observations

1. Seating arrangement: Prior to the conference, the coordinator met with Concentra and the LPC members to discuss the seating arrangements for the in-person conference. The initial seating arrangement had the CSVs in the middle of the back row. However, in order to facilitate potentially quick exits for reporting, the final setup entailed two dedicated seats at the rear of the main conference room for the CSV members. This was a useful configuration.
2. Volunteer recruitment and shifts: There was an increase in CSV Volunteers from 2024, which meant that there was adequate coverage during sessions.
    - New CSVs were paired with an experienced volunteer during the shift (two volunteers for each shift)
    - There was one online CSV per shift.
3. Identification on Slack: During the conference, the volunteers identified themselves by adding a purple heart emoji to their Slack ID. Instructions were provided pre-conference in the CSS Volunteer Resources on how to add the purple heart emoji.
