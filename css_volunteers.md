Current Community Support Volunteers
====================================

The following **volunteers** for the [Community Support Squad](csvcharge.md) have agreed to list their email addresses here for dealing with [Code of Code4Lib Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) issues that arise in Code4Lib channels **other** than the annual Code4Lib conference.

Please respect that these are **volunteers**: they are not available 24/7; there is no guarantee that any CSS members are monitoring the IRC, listserv, Slack, and/or Discord channels outside of the Code4Lib conference days.  

Therefore, it would be helpful to make sure you've provided context for your concern.
