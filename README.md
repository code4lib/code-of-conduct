Code4lib Anti-Harassment Policy
===============================

This is a repository to provide a space to draft and allow for dialog in the creation of an anti-harassment policy for the [Code4lib](http://code4lib.org/) annual conference, mailing list, and other Code4Lib channels.

Resources for policies/starting points:

* [The Ada Initiative: Anti-harassment work](http://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/conference-policies/)
* [Geek Feminism Wiki: example anti-harassment policy for conferences](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy)
* [how to hack code4lib: don't be sexist/racist/*ist](http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/How_to_hack_code4lib#Don.27t_be_sexist.2Fracist.2F.2Aist)
* [MoreThanMen.org Harassment policy examples for conferences ](http://www.morethanmen.org/harassment-policies/)
* [CAUT Anti-harassment and Non-Discrimination Statement](http://www.caut.ca/about-us/caut-policy/lists/administrative-procedures-and-guidelines/caut-anti-harassment-statement)
* [AAI Anti-harassment policy](http://www.atheistalliance.org/activities/23-conventions/507-anti-harassment-policy): This is a good one because it includes a short boilerplate statement for conferences/events, plus a longer document suitable for the organization as a whole. 

## Code of Code4Lib Conduct

The [Code of Code4Lib Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) is an evolving document that applies not only to the annual Code4Lib conference, but also to the other ways we interact, including the[Code4lib listserv](https://lists.clir.org/cgi-bin/wa?A0=CODE4LIB), irc, and other Code4Lib venues, such as the Slack and Discord channels. 

As we learn and grow, we welcome suggestions for changes.


You can make these suggestions in one of the following ways:

* If you are familiar with **git** and **GitHub**, you can fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a Pull Request.  See <a href="#contribute">"Contribute"</a>, below.
* You may create a new issue: [https://github.com/code4lib/antiharassment-policy/issues/new](<https://github.com/code4lib/antiharassment-policy/issues/new>)
* You can send an email to one or more of the people identified as members of the [Community Support Squad](css_volunteers.md).
