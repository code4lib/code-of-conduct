Code4lib Anti-Harassment Policy
===============================

This is a repository to provide a space to draft and allow for dialog in the creation of an anti-harassment policy for the [Code4lib](http://code4lib.org/) annual conference. 

Resources for policies/starting points:

* [The Ada Initiative: Anti-harassment work](http://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/conference-policies/)
* [Geek Feminism Wiki: example anti-harassment policy for conferences](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy)
* [howto hack code4lib: don't be sexist/racist/*ist](http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/How_to_hack_code4lib#Don.27t_be_sexist.2Fracist.2F.2Aist)
* [CAUT Anti-harassment and Non-Discrimination Statement](https://www.caut.ca/pages.asp?page=302&lang=1)
* [AAI Anti-harassment policy] (http://www.atheistalliance.org/activities/23-conventions/507-anti-harassment-policy): This is a good one because it includes a short boilerplate statement for conferences/events, plus a longer document suitable for the organization as a whole. 

Open questions:

* How do we cover not only the conference/IRL interactions, but IRC, etc. too?
* Do we require a [duty officer](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Duty_officer) explicitly? Is it fair/reasonable/workable to have conference staff be in that role?
