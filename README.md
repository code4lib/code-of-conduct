Code4lib Anti-Harassment Policy
===============================

This is a repository to provide a space to draft and allow for dialog in the creation of an anti-harassment policy for the [Code4lib](http://code4lib.org/) annual conference, mailing list, and other Code4Lib channels.

Resources for policies/starting points:

* [The Ada Initiative: Anti-harassment work](http://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/conference-policies/)
* [Geek Feminism Wiki: example anti-harassment policy for conferences](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy)
* [how to hack code4lib: don't be sexist/racist/*ist](http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/How_to_hack_code4lib#Don.27t_be_sexist.2Fracist.2F.2Aist)
* [MoreThanMen.org Harassment policy examples for conferences ](http://www.morethanmen.org/harassment-policies/)
* [CAUT Anti-harassment and Non-Discrimination Statement](http://www.caut.ca/about-us/caut-policy/lists/administrative-procedures-and-guidelines/caut-anti-harassment-statement)
* [AAI Anti-harassment policy](http://www.atheistalliance.org/activities/23-conventions/507-anti-harassment-policy): This is a good one because it includes a short boilerplate statement for conferences/events, plus a longer document suitable for the organization as a whole. 

## Code of Code4Lib Conduct

The [Code of Code4Lib Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) is an evolving document that applies not only to the annual Code4Lib conference, but also to the other ways we interact, including the [Code4lib listserv](https://lists.clir.org/cgi-bin/wa?A0=CODE4LIB), irc, and other Code4Lib venues, such as the Slack and Discord channels. 

Because a Code of Conduct is intended to protect community members from harm in community spaces and outlines unacceptable behavior, we have also outlined guidelines for positive engagement in the Code4Lib [community norms](norms.md).  

As we learn and grow, we welcome suggestions for changes.


You can make these suggestions in one of the following ways:

* If you are familiar with **git** and **GitHub**, you can fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a Pull Request.  See <a href="#contribute">"Contribute"</a>, below.
* You may create a new issue: [https://github.com/code4lib/code-of-conduct/issues/new](<https://github.com/code4lib/antiharassment-policy/issues/new>)
* You can send an email to one or more of the people identified as members of the [Community Support Squad](css_volunteers.md).
